      <details>
        <summary style="font-size: 20px; font-weight: bold;"> What is Forex and How Does It Work? </summary>
        <p>
          The Foreign Exchange Market (Forex or FX) is the world’s largest and most liquid financial market,
          where currencies are bought and sold 24 hours a day, five days a week. Forex trading involves
          exchanging one currency for another with the aim of making a profit based on price movements.
        </p>
        <p>
          The Forex market operates without a central exchange — it runs through a global network of banks,
          financial institutions, corporations, and individual traders. Trades happen electronically over-the-counter (OTC),
          meaning transactions occur directly between parties via computer networks, rather than on a centralized exchange.
        </p>
        <p>
          Prices in Forex are influenced by factors like:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Economic news and reports</li>
          <li>Interest rates</li>
          <li>Political stability</li>
          <li>Global events and trends</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
          Forex offers high liquidity, flexibility, and opportunities to trade with leverage, making it a popular
          choice for traders worldwide. With the right strategy and tools — like automated Expert Advisors (EAs) —
          traders can take advantage of market movements day and night.
        </p>
        <p>
          At <strong>[Your Website Name]</strong>, we help you navigate the Forex market with advanced technology and
          smart automation, empowering you to trade with confidence.

  <h2 class="center-text">Overview</h2>

  <h3>MetaTrader 4 Compatibility</h3>
  <p>
    Our EA is designed to run exclusively on MetaTrader 4 (MT4), which is widely regarded as one of the 
    best trading platforms available. While it currently supports MT4, we plan to include additional 
    platforms in future updates to broaden accessibility.
  </p>

  <h3>EA Setup</h3>
  <p>
    Once you purchase our EA, it will take up to 24 hours to set up and configure on your MT4 platform. 
    This setup time ensures that your EA is configured with the appropriate risk management settings 
    to align with your trading preferences.
  </p>

  <h3>Future Settings Changes</h3>
  <p>
    If you wish to make any adjustments to your EA settings after the initial setup, please notify us at 
    least 24 hours in advance. This will give us enough time to implement the changes and update 
    your EA configuration accordingly.
  </p>

  <h3>EA Files</h3>
  <p>
    Once your EA is successfully connected to your XM account, we will send the EA files directly to your 
    email. It is important to keep these files safe for future use or reinstallation.
  </p>

  <h3>Friday Trading Hours</h3>
  <p>
    Please note that the EA will not run the full day on Fridays due to the market closing at the end of 
    the trading week. As a result, the EA will only operate for a maximum of 12 hours on Fridays.
